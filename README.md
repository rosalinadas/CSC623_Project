# CSC623_Project - Project: Design, development and implementation of a relational database 
This project uses a hypothetical case study to create a relational database by following the steps to develop the conceptual, logical, and physical data model 
for the for the Oracle Enterprise DBMS.

## How to Run the Project
Open 'SQLproject.ipynb' using Jupyter Notebook. 
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) 
or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows).
You can run the notebook document step-by-step ( for each cell) by pressing shift + enter.
You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on  Cell -> Run All

## What does the Project do?
Running the 'SQLproject.ipynb' file creates a database 'petsclinic.db' with five tables and tuples containing data for each table. 
The program also provides five sample queries that can be executed using the relational database, to simulate user queries.
